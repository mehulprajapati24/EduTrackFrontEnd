Edu-Track
Edu-Track is a web-based management system designed to address common challenges faced by educational institutions in managing their academic and administrative tasks efficiently.

Purpose of Edu-Track
Educational institutions often struggle with:

Inefficient management of student, faculty, and class schedules.
Manual processes for updating academic timetables and records.
Difficulty in tracking academic progress.
A lack of centralized systems to resource management.
To solve these problems, Edu-Track was developed as a comprehensive platform to automate, organize, and optimize these processes while ensuring ease of use and accessibility for all stakeholders.
